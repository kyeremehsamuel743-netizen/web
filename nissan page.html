    <h2><u>History of Nissan</u></h2>
    
    <p>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. is a Japanese multinational automobile manufacturer headquartered in Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan. The company sells its vehicles under the Nissan and Infiniti brands, and formerly the Datsun brand, with in-house performance tuning products (including cars) under the Nismo and Autech brands. The company can be traced back to the beginning of the 20th century with the Nissan zaibatsu, or Nissan Group.

Since 1999, Nissan has been part of the Renault–Nissan–Mitsubishi Alliance (Mitsubishi joining in 2016), a partnership between Nissan and Mitsubishi Motors of Japan, with Renault of France. As of November 2023, Renault holds a 15% voting stake in Nissan, while Nissan holds the same stake in Renault. Since October 2016, Nissan held a 34% controlling stake in Mitsubishi Motors. In November 2024, Nissan reduced its stake in Mitsubishi Motors from 34% to 24%.

In 2017, Nissan was the sixth largest automaker in the world, after Toyota, Volkswagen Group, Hyundai Motor Group, General Motors and Ford. With a revenue of $78 billion in 2022, Nissan was the ninth largest automobile maker in the world.

Nissan planned to merge with Honda Motor Company in 2026, after an announcement in December 2024. However by February 2025, Nissan announced it would abandon merger plans as the automaker stated that it wanted to become an equal partner to Honda rather than a subsidiary. In November 2024, a Nissan executive was quoted as saying that the company had as little as 12 months left to live, barring any major events. As of 2025, Nissan is facing financial hardships but has implemented a recovery plan.
