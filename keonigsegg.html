    <h2><u>History of keonigsegg</u></h2>
    <p>
         &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Koenigsegg is a Swedish automotive company founded in 1994 by Christian von Koenigsegg at the age of 22, with the aim of producing world-class sports cars. Inspired by the Norwegian stop-motion film "The Pinchcliffe Grand Prix" during his childhood, Christian pursued his dream by gathering significant investments to start the company. Initially based in Olofström, the company later moved to Ängelholm, where its factory was established in an old airfield hangar, utilizing part of a military runway for high-speed testing.

The initial prototype, Koenigsegg CC, was designed by Christian himself, and after several years of development and testing—including overcoming the loss of engine suppliers—the company eventually began producing its own engines and transmissions, which is rare for a small sports car manufacturer. The first street-legal production car, the CC8S, debuted in 2002 and was soon recognized by Guinness World Records for having the most powerful engine in a production car at that time.

Over the years, Koenigsegg has continued to be a pioneer in hypercar design and technology, consistently pushing boundaries in performance and innovation. In July 2023, Koenigsegg opened a new factory in Ängelholm, doubling its production capacity while retaining its reputation for creating some of the fastest and most advanced cars in the world.

In summary, Koenigsegg's history is marked by the realization of a young visionary's dream to develop ultra-high-performance sports cars from humble beginnings to a globally recognized hypercar manufacturer celebrated for its innovation and engineering excellence.

     &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The company was founded in 1994 in Sweden by Christian von Koenigsegg, with the intention of producing a "world-class" sports car. Many years of development and testing led to the CC8S, the company's first street-legal production car, which was introduced in 2002.

In 2006, Koenigsegg began production of the CCX, which uses an engine created in-house specifically for the car. The goal was to develop a car homologated for use worldwide, particularly the United States whose strict regulations did not allow the import of earlier Koenigsegg models.

In March 2009, the CCXR was listed by Forbes as one of "the world's most beautiful cars".

In December 2010, the Agera won the BBC Top Gear Hypercar of the Year Award.

Apart from developing, manufacturing and selling the Koenigsegg line of sports cars, Koenigsegg is also involved in "green technology" development programmes beginning with the CCXR ("Flower Power") flex-fuel sports car and continuing through the present with the Jesko. Koenigsegg is also active in development programs of plug-in electric cars' systems and next-generation reciprocating engine technologies. Koenigsegg has also developed a camless piston engine which found its first application in the Gemera, which was introduced in 2020.

Koenigsegg develops and produces most of the main systems, subsystems and components needed for its cars in-house instead of relying on subcontractors.

In January 2019, Koenigsegg sold a 20% stake in the company to Swedish electric car manufacturer (Egstrand & Lundgren), National Electric Vehicle Sweden (NEVS), for US$171 million.

Koenigsegg has since then bought the stake back from NEVS in 2021 and owns 100% of the company again.

In mid-2023, Koenigsegg inaugurated a new factory, engineering and R&D facilities and a showroom in Ängelholm. At the end of 2023, Koenigsegg had just under 800 employees.

     &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Christian von Koenigsegg got the idea to build his own car after watching the Norwegian stop-motion animated movie The Pinchcliffe Grand Prix in his youth.At 22 years old, Koenigsegg gathered kr 60,000,000 from investors and founded Koenigsegg Automotive in 1994.

Initially, Koenigsegg Automotive was based in Olofström. In the early 2000s, the company moved to Ängelholm. On 22 February 2003, one of the production facilities caught fire and was badly damaged. Koenigsegg then acquired an abandoned air field to use as his new factory building and in late 2003, one of the two large fighter-jet hangars and an office building were converted into a car factory. Since then, the company is located near the still-active Ängelholm airport. Koenigsegg controls and uses the former military runway for shakedown runs of production cars and high-speed testing.

In July 2023 Koenigsegg opened a newly built factory, close to the old factory building in Ängeholm, doubling the production capacity.
