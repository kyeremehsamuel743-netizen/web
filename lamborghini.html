     <h2><u>History of Lamborghini</u></h2>
    <p>
         &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Automobili Lamborghini S.p.A. was founded by Ferruccio Lamborghini in 1963 in Sant'Agata Bolognese, Italy. Ferruccio, an industrial magnate who had success manufacturing tractors and air conditioners, established the company with the goal of producing refined grand touring cars that could compete with Ferrari. The first model presented was the 350 GTV prototype in 1963, which was reworked into the 350 GT, the first production car released in 1964. Lamborghini quickly gained acclaim with the 1966 Miura sports coupé, the first supercar featuring a rear mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout, setting a standard for high-performance cars.

The company experienced rapid growth in its first decade but faced financial struggles following the 1973 oil crisis and global economic downturn. Ferruccio Lamborghini sold his ownership and retired in 1974. The company went bankrupt in 1978 but was bought and revitalized in 1980 by the Mimran brothers, who expanded the lineup with models like the Jalpa and the LM002 off-road vehicle.

Lamborghini changed hands several times: bought by Chrysler in 1987, sold to Malaysian and Indonesian investors in 1994, and finally acquired by Volkswagen Group in 1998, where it became part of Audi. Under Volkswagen's ownership, Lamborghini expanded its lineup further and solidified its position as a maker of some of the most desirable and high-performance luxury sports cars in the world, including models like the Gallardo, Murciélago, Aventador, and Huracán.

Today, Lamborghini continues to focus on innovative design, extreme performance, and cutting-edge technology, maintaining its legacy as an iconic Italian supercar manufacturer.

   &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lamborghini grew rapidly during its first decade, but sales plunged in the wake of the 1973 worldwide financial downturn and the oil crisis. Ferruccio Lamborghini sold ownership of the company to Georges-Henri Rossetti and René Leimer and retired in 1974. The company went bankrupt in 1978, and was placed in the receivership of brothers Jean-Claude and Patrick Mimran in 1980, who purchased the company for US$3 million, renaming it Nuova Automobili Lamborghini SpA. As CEO and President, Patrick Mimran invested heavily in the company's expansion, and was later credited as being the man who saved Lamborghini. Under his management, Lamborghini's model line was expanded from the Countach to include the Jalpa entry-level sports car and the LM002 high performance off-road vehicle.

<p>
   &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Patrick Mimran sold Lamborghini to the Chrysler Corporation in 1987 for US$25 million. After replacing the Countach with the Diablo and discontinuing the Jalpa and the LM002, Chrysler sold Lamborghini to Malaysian investment group Mycom Setdco and Indonesian group V'Power Corporation in 1994. In 1998, Mycom Setdco and V'Power sold Lamborghini to the Volkswagen Group where it was placed under the control of the group's Audi division. New products and model lines were introduced to the brand's portfolio and this increased productivity for the brand.
