    <h2><u>History of Corvette</u></h2>
    
    <p>
         &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chevrolet Corvette is a line of American two-door, two-seater sports cars manufactured and marketed by General Motors under the Chevrolet marque since 1953. Throughout eight generations, indicated sequentially as C1 to C8, the Corvette is noted for its performance, distinctive styling, lightweight fiberglass or composite bodywork, and competitive pricing. The Corvette has had domestic mass-produced two-seater competitors fielded by American Motors, Ford, and Chrysler; it is the only one continuously produced by a United States auto manufacturer. It serves as Chevrolet's halo car.

In 1953, GM executives accepted a suggestion by Myron Scott, then the assistant director of the Public Relations department, to name the company's new sports car after the corvette, a small, maneuverable warship. Initially, a relatively modest, lightweight 6‑cylinder convertible, subsequent introductions of V8 engines, competitive chassis innovations, and rear mid-engined layout have gradually moved the Corvette upmarket into the supercar class. In 1963, the second generation was introduced in coupe and convertible styles. The first three Corvette generations (1953–1982) employed body-on-frame construction, and since the C4 generation, introduced in 1983 as an early 1984 model, Corvettes have used GM's unibody Y‑body platform. All Corvettes used front mid-engine configuration for seven generations, through 2019, and transitioned to a rear mid-engined layout with the C8 generation.

Initially manufactured in Flint, Michigan, and St. Louis, Missouri, the Corvette has been produced in Bowling Green, Kentucky, since 1981, which is also the location of the National Corvette Museum. The Corvette has become widely known as "America's Sports Car." Automotive News wrote that after being featured in the early 1960s television show Route 66, "the Corvette became synonymous with freedom and adventure," ultimately becoming both "the most successful concept car in history and the most popular sports car in history.

         &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first generation of Corvette was introduced late in the 1953 model year, appearing as a show car for the 1953 General Motors Motorama, January 17–23 at New York's Waldorf-Astoria Hotel. At the time, Chevrolet general manager Thomas H. Keating said it was six months to a year away from production readiness. The car generated sufficient interest for mass production to begin on June 30, 1953.

Uniquely, the original Corvette used fiberglass bodywork, its reinforcement placed by hand. This generation was often referred to as the "solid-axle" models, with independent rear suspension appearing in the next. Three hundred hand-built Corvette convertibles were produced, all Polo White, for the 1953 model year.

The 1954 model year vehicles could be ordered in Pennant Blue, Sportsman Red, Black, or Polo White; 3,640 were manufactured.

The 1953, 1954, and 1955 model years were the only Corvettes equipped with a 235 cu in (3.9 L) version of the second-generation Blue Flame inline-six rated at 150 hp (112 kW; 152 PS).

The 1955 model offered a 265 cu in (4.34 L) V8 engine as an option. The new V8 improved 0–60 mph (0–97 km/h) acceleration by 3 seconds. With a large inventory of unsold 1954 models, GM limited production to 700 units for 1955. Despite the poor sales of the Corvette at the time, the V8 was a popular option, with an estimated six cars produced with the inline-six.

Three new competitors, the Ford Thunderbird, the Studebaker Speedster, and the larger Chrysler C-300 were introduced that same year.

         &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A new body was introduced for the 1956 model featuring a revised front end and side coves; the taillamp fins were deleted.[19] An optional "Ramjet" fuel injection system was made available midway through the 1957 model year. It was one of the first American mass-produced engines in history to reach 1 horsepower per cubic inch (0.046 kW/cm3) and Chevrolet's advertising agency used a "one hp per cubic inch" slogan for advertising the 283 hp (211 kW; 287 PS) 283 cu in (4.64 L) Small-Block engine. Other options included power windows (1956), hydraulically assisted convertible top (1956), heavy-duty brakes and suspension (1957), and four-speed manual transmission (late 1957). Delco Radio transistorized signal-seeking "hybrid" car radio, which used both vacuum tubes and transistors in its radio's circuitry (1956 option).

The 1958 Corvette received a body and interior revisions including a longer front end with quad headlamps, bumper exiting exhaust tips, revised steering wheel, and a dashboard with all gauges mounted directly in front of the driver. For 1958 only were 1958 hood louvers and twin trunk spears. The 1959–60 model years had few changes except a decreased amount of body chrome and more powerful engine offerings.

In 1961, the rear of the car was completely redesigned with the addition of a tapered tail with four round lights. The light treatment would continue for all following model year Corvettes until 2014. In 1962, the Chevrolet 283 cu in (4.64 L) Small-Block was enlarged to 327 cu in (5.36 L). In standard form it was rated at 250 hp (186 kW; 253 PS). For an additional 12% over list price, the fuel-injected version produced 360 hp (268 kW; 365 PS), making it the fastest of the C1 generation. 1962 was also the last year for the wraparound windshield, solid rear axle, and convertible-only body style. The trunk lid and exposed headlamps did not reappear for many decades.
