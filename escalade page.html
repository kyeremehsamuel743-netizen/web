    <h2><u>History of Escalade</u></h2>
        
    <p>
         &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cadillac Escalade is a full-size luxury SUV manufactured by General Motors and marketed by Cadillac as its first major entry into the SUV market. The Escalade was introduced for the 1999 model year in response to an influx of new luxury SUVs in the late 1990s including the Mercedes-Benz M-Class, Range Rover, Lexus LX, and Ford's 1998 debut of the Lincoln Navigator. The Escalade project went into production only ten months after it was approved. The Escalade is built in Arlington, Texas.

The term "escalade" refers to a siege warfare tactic of scaling defensive walls or ramparts with the aid of ladders or siege towers. More generally, it is a French word which is the noun-equivalent form of the French verb escalader, which means "to climb or scale".

The Escalade is currently sold in North America and select international markets (Europe and Asia) where Cadillac has official sales channels. The Escalade ESV (Escalade Stretch Vehicle) is sold in North America, Russia, and the Middle East, but is only available by special order in some international markets. The right-hand-drive Escalade and Escalade ESV are available through third-party conversion specialists without official agreement with Cadillac in Australian, Oceanic, and Japanese markets.

On August 8, 2023, GM presented the Escalade IQ, an all-electric version of the Escalade, and the third model in Cadillac's EV line, after the Celestiq, and Lyriq. It is expected to go on sale in late 2024 for the 2025 model year, with a starting price of $130,000.

The Escalade has gone through five generations, the most recent (the fifth) presented in 2021, noted for its technology and self-driving capability. The fifth generation Escalade is nearly two metres high, and was criticized by The Verge for its excessive size and hazard to pedestrians.

        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The introduction of the Lincoln Navigator in the 1998 model year necessitated that General Motors be able to compete in the burgeoning American market for full-size luxury-type trucks. This generation was only a five-seat (two-row) SUV. Fearing the growing hegemony of the Lincoln Navigator, the Escalade was rushed through the design process to reach dealers quickly. Essentially little more than a badge-engineered GMC Yukon Denali, the SUV's aesthetics were similar to the Denali and the final vehicle was smaller than the Navigator. The Escalade's underpinnings were borrowed from the Yukon Denali line, with the GMC logos on the center caps replaced with Cadillac's crest. The Escalade also used the same 5.7L Vortec 5700 V8 at 255 hp (190 kW) as found in all other GMT400-based models, which was underpowered compared to the Navigator's 300 hp (224 kW) and 365 lb⋅ft (495 N⋅m) 5.4L InTech V8. All first-generation Escalades and Denalis featured Auto-Trac selectable 4×4. The 1999–2000 Escalade achieved 11 mpg‑US (21 L/100 km) city and 15 mpg‑US (16 L/100 km) highway based on U.S. EPA test protocols.

         &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first-generation Escalade (as well as its mechanically identical twin, the GMC Yukon Denali), was available only in the short-wheelbase 4-door wagon configuration with few options. The GMC Yukon Denali was heavily differentiated from the standard Yukon models with a unique front hood, fenders, grille, headlamps, and bumper cover, color-keyed mirrors and door handles, a unique paint-matched roof rack and running boards, and lower paint-matched cladding all around with embossed emblems. The only exterior differences for the Escalade (other than badging) were a slightly different grille treatment and smooth cladding with emblems placed on the sheet metal. The interior design, however, would differ significantly between the two models. Denali already added unique two-tone seats, genuine zebrano wood trim on the front-window switch panels and unique center console, chromed interior door handles, "Yukon Denali" embroidery on the door panels, a color keyed steering wheel, and a unique instrument cluster versus the standard Yukon. Escalade would add additional real wood trim on all four door panels and steering wheel, imitation wood on the instrument panel, and "Cadillac" script on the console veneer, a color-keyed steering column, leather-wrapped column shifter, and unique front and rear seats with perforated leather, a Cadillac crest embroidered on the headrests, and a storage compartment in the rear seat armrest.

Both vehicles included a generous amount of standard equipment not available on other GM full-size SUVs, including 16-inch chrome-clad aluminum-alloy wheels, a Bose Acoustimass seven-speaker stereo (including subwoofer), an in-dash CD player and console-mounted six-CD changer, auto-dimming exterior and rearview mirrors with compass and temperature display, automatic headlamps with daytime running lights, front projector fog lamps, heated front and rear seats, rear-seat audio controls, a BCM (body control module) providing functions such as retained accessory power and interior illumination fade-off, a unique warning chime, a special coating used on the dashboard for a more premium appearance, front and rear Bilstein shock absorbers, and unique engine and transmission tuning for a more refined driving experience. An OnStar in-vehicle telematics and communications system was optional on the Denali but standard on the Escalade, with the only other option for both models being a choice between twin rear barn doors or a split tailgate with rear-window wiper. A dealer-installed cellular telephone was also available with factory provisions in the center console.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Colors available on the Escalade were Silver Sand Metallic, Sable Black, Aspen White, and Bordeaux Red Metallic. All Escalades came with a Neutral Shale interior. Yukon Denali colors shared with the Escalade were named Black Onyx and Dark Toreador Red Metallic, and exclusive colors to the Denali were Silvermist Metallic, Spruce Green Metallic, Meadow Green Metallic, and Gold Metallic. The Denali featured a two-tone interior available in Canyon Tan or Stone Gray.
