   <h2><u>History of Honda</u></h2>
   
   <p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Honda's history began with founder Soichiro Honda's mechanical passion, starting with piston rings and growing into the Honda Motor Company in 1948, rapidly dominating the motorcycle market with iconic models like the Dream D-Type before successfully entering the automobile world with the T360 mini-truck in 1963 and later the influential Accord in the 1970s, establishing a global reputation for innovation, quality, and reliability, and expanding into luxury (Acura), power equipment, and even aerospace.

   <p>
   &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Honda Motor Co., Ltd.,[a] commonly known as Honda, is a Japanese multinational conglomerate automotive manufacturer headquartered at the Toranomon Alcea Tower in Toranomon, Minato, Tokyo, Japan.

Founded in October 1946 by Soichiro Honda, Honda has been the world's largest motorcycle manufacturer since 1959, reaching a production of 500 million as of May 2025. It is the world's largest manufacturer of internal combustion engines measured by number of units, producing more than 14 million internal combustion engines each year. Honda became the second-largest Japanese automobile manufacturer in 2001. In 2015, Honda was the eighth largest automobile manufacturer in the world. Honda has built and sold the most produced motor vehicle in history, the Honda Super Cub.

<p>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Honda was the first Japanese automobile manufacturer to release a dedicated luxury brand, Acura, in March 1986. Aside from their core automobile and motorcycle businesses, Honda also manufactures garden equipment, marine engines, personal watercraft, power generators, and other products. Since 1986, Honda has been involved with artificial intelligence/robotics research and released their ASIMO robot in 2000. They have ventured into aerospace with the establishment of GE Honda Aero Engines in 2004 and the Honda HA-420 HondaJet, which began production in 2012. Honda has two joint-ventures in China: Dongfeng Honda and GAC Honda.

In 2013, Honda invested about 5.7% (US$6.8 billion) of its revenues into research and development. Also in 2013, Honda became the first Japanese automaker to be a net exporter from the United States, exporting 108,705 Honda and Acura models, while importing only 88,357.

     &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout his life, Honda's founder, Soichiro Honda (1906–1991), had an interest in automobiles. He worked as a mechanic at the Art Shokai garage, where he tuned cars and entered them in races. In 1937, with financing from his acquaintance Kato Shichirō, Honda founded Tōkai Seiki (Eastern Sea Precision Machine Company) to make piston rings working out of the Art Shokai garage. After initial failures, Tōkai Seiki won a contract to supply piston rings to Toyota, but lost the contract due to the poor quality of their products. After attending engineering school without graduating, and visiting factories around Japan to better understand Toyota's quality control processes known as "five whys", by 1941 Honda was able to mass-produce piston rings acceptable to Toyota, using an automated process that could employ even unskilled wartime laborers.
