    <h2><u>History of Ferrari</u></h2>
   
    <p>
         &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enzo Ferrari decided to pursue racing in 1908, at the age of ten: to this end, he eventually began a career as a racing driver in 1919.[1]: 31  During the 1920s he worked for Alfa Romeo, both as a driver in various local races and as an employee in its Milan sales depot.[2][3] In 1929, though, he broke from this line of work to found and manage his own racing team, which he named Scuderia Ferrari. Conceived as an outfit for gentleman drivers and other amateurs, the team was founded through a million-lira loan from a local bank, with additional backing from the wealthy amateur racer Mario Tadini, Augusto and Alfredo Caniato — two brothers in the textile industry — and the tyre company Pirelli. It would be based out of Modena, Enzo's hometown.

Enzo quickly set about negotiating with Giorgio Rimini, Alfa Romeo's commercial director, and managed to secure a partnership between their respective companies. The intended arrangement was simple: Alfa Romeo would outfit their factory team, Alfa Corse, with its latest, most sophisticated cars, while Ferrari's scuderia ('stable')[3] of amateurs would use lower-end cars and hand-me-downs from past seasons. Additionally, Ferrari would operate independently from Alfa Romeo, such that the automaker would be insulated from negative press whenever the team placed poorly. Enzo presented this as beneficial to everyone involved, as it allowed Alfa Romeo to stay active in racing with minimal effects on their other ventures.[3] The team's first race was the 1930 Mille Miglia, using cars supplied by Alfa Romeo,[5] and the first use of the Prancing Horse logo was at the 1932 24 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps

         &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This initial arrangement did not last. After Alfa Romeo came under the control of the Italian state in 1933, their racing division was downsized, and Scuderia Ferrari functioned as the unofficial company team throughout the mid-1930s.[3] Leading up to the 1934 Grand Prix season, Ferrari began conducting their own research and development while Alfa Romeo continued to supply racing cars,[5] a situation that led to vehicles being engineered within Ferrari themselves. These include a streamlined variant of the Type B optimised for AVUS, and the Bimotore, also based on the Type B, which was driven by two engines at once: one in front of the driver and another behind, each driving the rear wheels through a special split differential.[3][4] These "first Ferraris" tended to be ad hoc and relatively primitive, as Alfa Romeo was facing rough financial outcomes with negligible support from the Italian government.[5] During its heyday, the Scuderia Ferrari of the 1930s employed several notable figures including Vittorio Jano, who served as the team's chief designer, and drivers such as Antonio Ascari, Giuseppe Campari, and Tazio Nuvolari.

         &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ferrari's history officially began in 1947 when Enzo Ferrari founded Ferrari S.p.A. in Maranello, Italy, after a long career as a racing driver and manager for Alfa Romeo. Initially, Ferrari focused on building high-performance sports cars and quickly achieved success with the 125 S, the company's first road car, which won its debut race the same year. Prior to founding Ferrari, Enzo had established the racing team Scuderia Ferrari in 1929, initially associated with Alfa Romeo.

The company gained prominence in motorsport early, winning its first Formula 1 season in 1952 and establishing a legacy of racing excellence with legendary drivers such as Alberto Ascari. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, Ferrari produced iconic road cars and racing models, such as the 250 GT series, blending racing technologies into luxury vehicles.

Ferrari became public in 1960 and sought partners to handle manufacturing, ultimately resulting in Fiat acquiring a significant stake starting in 1969. This partnership allowed Ferrari to modernize and expand its lineup with influential models like the Dino 206 GT, its first mass-produced mid-engined car, signaling a shift from its traditional front-engine V12 designs.

The brand is synonymous with luxury, innovation, and high-performance racing achievement, maintaining a close tie between its Formula 1 success and road car development. Ferrari remains headquartered in Maranello, continuing to produce some of the most coveted sports cars ever made while being a formidable presence in motorsport.
