   <h2><u>History of Volvo</u></h2>
  
   <p>
     &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Volvo's history began in Gothenburg, Sweden, in 1927, founded by Assar Gabrielsson and Gustaf Larson to build sturdy cars for Swedish roads, with its first car, the ÖV4 ("Jakob"), launching that year, and quickly establishing a reputation for safety, most notably with the 1959 introduction of the three-point seatbelt, a patent Volvo shared freely, solidifying its safety image before being sold to Ford in 1999 and later acquired by China's Geely Holding Group in 2010, while remaining a global brand known for innovative safety and quality vehicles.

    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Volvo Group (Swedish: Volvokoncernen, pronounced [ˈvɔlːvʊˌkɔnˈsæːɳɛn]; legally Aktiebolaget Volvo ([ˈakːsɪɛbʊˌlɑːɡɛt ˈvɔlːvʊ]), shortened to AB Volvo ([ˈoːˈbeː ˈvɔlːvʊ]), stylized as VOLVO) is a Swedish multinational manufacturing corporation headquartered in Gothenburg. While its core activity is the production, distribution and sale of trucks, buses and construction equipment, Volvo also supplies marine and industrial drive systems and financial services. In 2016, it was the world's second-largest manufacturer of heavy-duty trucks through its subsidiary Volvo Trucks.

Volvo was founded in 1927. Initially involved in the automobile industry, Volvo expanded into other manufacturing sectors throughout the twentieth century. Automobile manufacturer Volvo Cars, also based in Gothenburg, was part of AB Volvo until 1999, when it was sold to the Ford Motor Company. Since 2010 Volvo Cars has been owned by the automotive company Geely Holding Group. Both AB Volvo and Volvo Cars share the Volvo logo and cooperate in running the World of Volvo museum in Gothenburg, Sweden.

The corporation was first listed on the Stockholm Stock Exchange in 1935, and was listed on the American NASDAQ from 1985 to 2007. Volvo is one of Sweden's largest companies by market capitalisation and revenue.

    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The brand name Volvo was originally registered as a trademark in May 1911, with the intention to be used for a new series of SKF ball bearings. It means "I roll" in Latin, conjugated from "volvere". The idea was short-lived, and SKF decided to simply use its initials as the trademark for all its bearing products.

In 1924, Assar Gabrielsson, an SKF sales manager, and Gustav Larson, a KTH educated engineer, decided to start construction of a Swedish car. They intended to build cars that could withstand the rigours of the country's rough roads and cold temperatures.

AB Volvo began activities on 10 August 1926. After one year of preparations involving the production of ten prototypes, the firm was ready to commence the car-manufacturing business within the SKF group. The Volvo Group considers itself to have started in 1927, when the first car, a Volvo ÖV 4, rolled off the production line at the factory in Hisingen, Gothenburg. Only 280 cars were built that year.[12] The first truck, the "Series 1", debuted in January 1928 as an immediate success, and attracted attention outside the country.[9] In 1930, Volvo sold 639 cars,[12] and the export of trucks to Europe started soon after; the cars did not become well known outside Sweden until after World War II. AB Volvo was introduced at the Stockholm Stock Exchange in 1935 and SKF then decided to sell its shares in the company. By 1942, Volvo acquired the Swedish precision engineering company Svenska Flygmotor (later renamed as Volvo Aero).

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pentaverken, which had manufactured engines for Volvo, was acquired in 1935, providing a secure supply of engines and entry into the marine engine market.

The first bus, named B1, was launched in 1934, and aircraft engines were added to the growing range of products at the beginning of the 1940s. Volvo was also responsible for producing the Stridsvagn m/42. In 1963, Volvo opened the Volvo Halifax Assembly plant, the first assembly plant in the company's history outside of Sweden in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada.

In 1950, Volvo acquired the Swedish construction and agricultural equipment manufacturer Bolinder-Munktell. Bolinder-Munktell was renamed as Volvo BM in 1973.In 1979, Volvo BM's agricultural equipment business was sold to Valmet. Later, through restructuring and acquisitions, the remaining construction equipment business became Volvo Construction Equipment.
