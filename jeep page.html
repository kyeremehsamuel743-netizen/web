   <h2><u>History of Jeep</u></h2>
  <p>
     &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jeep's history began in World War II when the U.S. Army needed a light, 4x4 reconnaissance vehicle, leading to Willys-Overland and Ford producing the iconic "Jeep" for the military. After the war, Willys transitioned it to the civilian CJ (Civilian Jeep), popularizing its ruggedness for farms and off-roading, and the brand evolved through ownership by companies like Kaiser, AMC, Chrysler (now Stellantis). Jeep expanded its lineup with famous models like the Wagoneer and Cherokee, becoming a symbol of adventure, freedom, and all-terrain capability.

    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jeep is an American automobile brand, now owned by multi-national corporation Stellantis. Jeep has been part of Chrysler since 1987, when Chrysler acquired the Jeep brand, along with other assets, from its previous owner, American Motors Corporation (AMC).

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jeep's current product range consists solely of sport utility vehicles—both crossovers and fully off-road worthy SUVs and models, including one pickup truck. Previously, Jeep's range included other pick-ups, as well as small vans, and a few roadsters. Some of Jeep's vehicles—such as the Grand Cherokee—reach into the luxury SUV segment, a market segment the 1963 Wagoneer is considered to have started. Jeep sold 1.4 million SUVs globally in 2016, up from 500,000 in 2008, two-thirds of which in North America, and was Fiat-Chrysler's best selling brand in the U.S. during the first half of 2017. In the U.S. alone, over 2400 dealerships hold franchise rights to sell Jeep-branded vehicles, and if Jeep were spun off into a separate company, it is estimated to be worth between $22 and $33.5 billion—slightly more than all of FCA (US). Bob Broderdorf is the current CEO of the Jeep brand worldwide.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to 1940 the term "jeep" had been used as U.S. Army slang for new recruits or vehicles, but the World War II "jeep" that went into production in 1941 specifically tied the name to this light military 4×4, arguably making them the oldest four-wheel drive mass-production vehicles now known as SUVs.The Jeep became the primary light four-wheel-drive vehicle of the United States Armed Forces and the Allies during World War II, as well as the postwar period. The term became common worldwide in the wake of the war. Doug Stewart noted:[13] "The spartan, cramped, and unstintingly functional jeep became the ubiquitous World War II four-wheeled personification of Yankee ingenuity and cocky, can-do determination." It is the precursor of subsequent generations of military light utility vehicles such as the Humvee, and inspired the creation of civilian analogs such as the original Series I Land Rover. Many Jeep variants serving similar military and civilian roles have since been designed in other nations.

<p>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Jeep marque has been headquartered in Toledo, Ohio, ever since Willys–Overland launched production of the first CJ or Civilian Jeep branded models there in 1945. Its replacement, the conceptually consistent Jeep Wrangler series, has remained in production since 1986. With its solid axles and open top, the Wrangler has been called the Jeep model that is as central to the brand's identity as the 911 is to Porsche.

At least two Jeep models (the CJ-5 and the SJ Wagoneer) enjoyed extraordinary three-decade production runs of a single body generation.

In lowercase, the term "jeep" continues to be used as a generic term for vehicles inspired by the Jeep that are suitable for use on rough terrain. In Iceland, the word Jeppi (derived from Jeep) has been used since World War II and is still used for any type of SUV.
